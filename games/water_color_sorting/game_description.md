# Water Color Sorting Game

## Description

Water Color Sorting is a fun and challenging puzzle game that tests logic and problem-solving skills. The objective is to sort the colored water in test tubes until each tube contains only one color. The game starts with multiple test tubes, each containing a mixture of different colors, and the player must carefully pour the liquid to separate them correctly.

## Rules

1. **Pouring**: You can only pour water from one test tube to another if the topmost layer of the liquid matches the color in the receiving tube or if the receiving tube is empty.
2. **One Color Per Tube**: The goal is to ensure that each tube contains only one color at the end of the level.
3. **Limited Moves** (Optional): Some game modes may restrict the number of moves, requiring more strategic thinking.
4. **Undo and Hints**: Depending on the game version, players may have limited undo options and hints to help them when stuck.
5. **Extra Tubes**: Some levels provide additional empty tubes to facilitate sorting, while others require players to work with limited space.

## Gameplay

-   Tap a test tube to select it and then tap another to pour the topmost color into it.
-   Plan ahead to avoid getting stuck with unsortable combinations.
-   Complete the level by successfully sorting all colors into separate tubes.

The game gradually increases in difficulty, making it a relaxing yet mentally engaging experience for puzzle lovers.
